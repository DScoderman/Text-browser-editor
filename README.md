# Text-browser-editor

## Description

A text browser editor for all your text edit needs! This app focuses on dealing and using progressive web applications. To make it happen, webpack, babel and service workers were used to clean and sort everything out. 

## Installation 

To get all the tools you need, just enter the command "npm i" to get everything set up. As we are using a live server, you'll need some way to deploy it online for it to work. In my case I used heroku to 
accomplish this. 

## Usage

To begin, make sure that the packages are installed and that babel, webpack-plugin, serviceworker, and nodemon are installed via running an "npm I". to get everything running, you'll also need to enter the following command: "npm start build" to test functionality online. Once done, it will take a moment to load but you can now test it on your own computer. To do that, go to your browser of choice (I used chrome)
and enter the follwing into your browser: "http://localhost:3000/". From there, the JATE should load and you can now play around in the progressive web app!
